The Marble Madness project involves creating a replica of the game Marble Madness for NachenGames by analyzing stolen prototype files from SmallSoft. Players navigate robot-infested mazes to collect crystals, avoiding hazards and enemies while aiming to complete all levels with limited lives. The game features smooth animation, tick-based gameplay, and dynamic object interactions, including movement, shooting, and scoring mechanisms.
